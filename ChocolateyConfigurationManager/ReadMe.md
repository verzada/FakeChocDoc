# Hi there!

Start with the [PreReq](https://github.com/verzada/FakeChocDoc/blob/UnOfficial/ChocolateyConfigurationManager/PreReq.md) to get going with Chocolatey Configuration Manager if this this is your first time.

Otherwise look at the [quick startup script](https://github.com/verzada/FakeChocDoc/blob/UnOfficial/ChocolateyConfigurationManager/Using-the-ccm-script.md)

Good luck!
