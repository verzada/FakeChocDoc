# Single server installation script 

The script [CCM.ps1](https://github.com/verzada/FakeChocDoc/blob/UnOfficial/ChocolateyConfigurationManager/Script/CCM.ps1) can install the entire Chocolatey Configuration Manager in one go. However, that's assuming that you don't need a service account for running the agent and management service, plus have a sql user for the database.
